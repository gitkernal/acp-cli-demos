# Agent Setup

Use this repo as the canonical source for reusable ACP agent skills and local agent utilities.

## Skill Source Of Truth

Keep shared skills under `skills/` in this repo. Agent-specific setup should install or link those skills into each agent runtime:

- Codex reads reusable user skills from `~/.agents/skills/`.
- Claude Code reads reusable skills from `~/.claude/skills/`.

Each contributed skill should be self-contained under `skills/<skill-name>/`. Put its `SKILL.md`, metadata, references, and validation examples in that folder instead of splitting one skill across separate top-level demo directories.

Shared skill sources:

- [`skills/acp-builder-setup`](../skills/acp-builder-setup) - setup and routing guidance for Codex, Claude Code, and Claude Desktop.
- [`skills/acp-paid-subscription-checkout`](../skills/acp-paid-subscription-checkout) - live local checkout execution, desktop-safe handoff, and redacted evidence review.

Public GitHub references are listed in [`docs/skill-packages.md`](skill-packages.md).

This repo does not check in project-scope `.agents/skills` or `.claude/skills` aliases. The canonical source is `skills/`; builders install or symlink the skills they want into their local agent runtime.

For active development, prefer symlinks so local skill edits are picked up by both tools:

```bash
scripts/install-local-skills.sh --mode symlink --target both
```

For one-off local installs, copying is fine:

```bash
scripts/install-local-skills.sh --mode copy --target both
```

## Model Routing Utilities

Codex and Claude Code need different local routing surfaces when using Virtuals-hosted models:

- Codex custom providers call `/v1/responses`; use [`utilities/model-routing/codex-virtuals-proxy`](../utilities/model-routing/codex-virtuals-proxy).
- Claude Code calls Anthropic-compatible `/v1/messages`; use [`utilities/model-routing/claude-virtuals-router`](../utilities/model-routing/claude-virtuals-router) with `claude-code-router`.

Keep shared utilities in `utilities/` so setup docs, skills, and examples evolve together.

## Desktop Support Matrix

| Surface | Skills from this repo | Virtuals routing utility | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Codex CLI | Yes, via explicit install or symlink to `~/.agents/skills` | Yes, via `utilities/model-routing/codex-virtuals-proxy` and `~/.codex/config.toml` | Supported |
| Codex Desktop app | Yes, Codex app loads the same Codex skill system | Yes, Codex app uses the same local agent configuration layers as CLI/IDE | Supported for local threads when the proxy is running |
| Claude Code terminal | Yes, via explicit install or symlink to `~/.claude/skills` | Yes, via `utilities/model-routing/claude-virtuals-router` and `ccr code` | Supported |
| Claude Desktop app | Yes, for uploadable ZIP packages in `packages/claude-desktop`; not from `~/.claude/skills` | Not via `claude-code-router`; Desktop does not use `ccr code` | Supported for setup, handoff, and evidence review |

### Claude Desktop Notes

Claude Desktop has its own skills surface through Claude settings. Upload the zipped packages in [`packages/claude-desktop`](../packages/claude-desktop) for account-level use. This is separate from Claude Code's local filesystem skills.

The combined ACP checkout skill selects handoff or evidence-review mode in Claude Desktop. It must not issue cards, retrieve OTPs, enter payment details, or click paid checkout buttons unless those local capabilities are available through a dedicated MCP server or Desktop extension. Run live checkout execution in Codex CLI/Desktop local thread or Claude Code.

`claude-code-router` is a Claude Code terminal integration. It starts Claude Code with local environment overrides and a local `/v1/messages` router. Claude Desktop will not automatically inherit that router config.
